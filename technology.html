                <h3>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="texto">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are advanced nuclear reactors with a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit, which is about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors. SMRs can produce a large amount of low-carbon electricity and are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small:</strong> Physically a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modular:</strong> Systems and components can be factory-assembled and transported as a unit to a location for installation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reactors:</strong> Harnessing nuclear fission to generate heat to produce energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of SMRs:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SMRs can be sited on locations not suitable for larger nuclear power plants due to their smaller footprint.</li>
                    <li>Prefabricated units can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on-site, making them more affordable to build than large power reactors.</li>
                    <li>SMRs offer savings in cost and construction time and can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand.</li>
                    <li>SMRs can be installed into an existing grid or remotely off-grid, providing low-carbon power for industry and the population.</li>
                    <li>Microreactors, a subset of SMRs, are designed to generate electrical power typically up to 10 MW(e) and are suited for regions inaccessible to clean, reliable, and affordable energy.</li>
                    <li>SMRs often rely on passive safety systems and inherent safety characteristics, such as low power and operating pressure, reducing the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity.</li>
                    <li>SMRs have reduced fuel requirements and may require less frequent refueling, every 3 to 7 years, compared to 1 to 2 years for conventional plants. Some SMRs are designed to operate for up to 30 years without refueling.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Current Developments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia's Akademik Lomonosov, the world's first floating nuclear power plant, began commercial operation in May 2020, producing energy from two 35 MW(e) SMRs.</li>
                    <li>Other SMRs are under construction or in the licensing stage in Argentina, Canada, China, Russia, South Korea, and the United States.</li>
                    <li>More than 80 commercial SMR designs are being developed worldwide, targeting varied outputs and different applications, such as electricity, hybrid energy systems, heating, water desalination, and steam for industrial applications.</li>

                <h3>Fission</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="texto">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nuclear fission is the process of splitting atomic nuclei to release energy. This technology has been the cornerstone of nuclear power generation since the 1950s. Fission reactors use uranium or plutonium as fuel, and the energy released from the fission process is used to generate electricity.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Energy Density:</strong> Fission provides a high energy density, meaning a small amount of nuclear fuel can produce a large amount of energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon-Free:</strong> Fission reactors do not produce carbon emissions during operation, making them a clean energy source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Fission reactors can operate continuously for long periods, providing a stable and reliable source of electricity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Current Developments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Reactors:</strong> New-generation reactors are being developed to improve safety, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. These include designs like the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) and the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR).</li>
                    <li><strong>Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs):</strong> MSRs use a molten salt mixture as the primary coolant or fuel. They operate at higher temperatures, improving thermal efficiency and reducing reactor size. MSRs have inherent safety features, such as low operating pressure and passive cooling systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Neutron Reactors (FNRs):</strong> FNRs use fast neutrons to sustain the fission process. They offer higher fuel efficiency and can utilize a broader range of fuels, including spent nuclear fuel and thorium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research Initiatives:</strong> Institutions like MIT are leading research in advanced fission technologies, focusing on reactor design, fuel cycles, and energy conversion systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fusion</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="texto">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nuclear fusion is the process of combining atomic nuclei to release energy, similar to the reactions that power the sun. Fusion has the potential to provide a virtually limitless source of clean energy, but it presents significant scientific and engineering challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abundant Fuel Supply:</strong> Fusion uses isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, which are abundant and can be extracted from water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Fusion reactions do not produce long-lived radioactive waste, and there is no risk of a runaway reaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Energy Output:</strong> Fusion has the potential to produce significantly more energy than fission, making it an attractive long-term energy solution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Current Developments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITER Project:</strong> The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a major international collaboration aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of fusion power. It is currently under construction in France and is expected to achieve first plasma in the coming years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE):</strong> Research institutions like SLAC are developing technologies to support inertial fusion energy, which involves using lasers to compress and heat fuel targets to achieve fusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Private Sector Involvement:</strong> Companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Helion Energy are making significant strides in developing commercial fusion reactors.</li>
                </ul>
