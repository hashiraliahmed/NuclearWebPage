            <h2>0. Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Nuclear energy contributes ~19% of U.S. electricity and is the largest source of carbon-free power. The U.S. aims to triple nuclear capacity by 2050 (DOE). Although nuclear has high upfront costs, it offers low long-term operating costs (IEA). Emerging trends include Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and fusion. Key challenges include waste disposal, safety regulations, and an aging reactor fleet.</p>

            <h2>1. Overview of Nuclear Energy</h2>
            <p>Nuclear energy is generated from nuclear fission (splitting atoms) and fusion (combining atoms). Currently, fission is used in today’s nuclear power plants. The U.S. has 93 commercial reactors across 28 states, making it the largest nuclear fleet globally with ~95 GW capacity, contributing ~19% of U.S. electricity. Nuclear power is reliable with a high capacity factor (~93%), carbon-free with no direct CO₂ emissions, and highly energy-dense (1 uranium fuel pellet = 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas).</p>

            <h2>2. Nuclear Technology & Innovations</h2>
            <p>Traditional reactors include Light Water Reactors (LWRs) such as Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), with over 90% of U.S. reactors being PWRs. Advanced reactor designs include Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) which offer lower costs and flexible deployment, Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) with enhanced safety and thorium use, and Fast Neutron Reactors (FNRs) which provide higher fuel efficiency and reduced waste. Fusion energy has the potential to become a $2.1 trillion market by mid-century, with major players like ITER and U.S. startups such as Helion Energy and Commonwealth Fusion, though commercial viability is still decades away.</p>

            <h2>3. U.S. Nuclear Market & Economic Outlook</h2>
            <p>The U.S. nuclear market currently has a capacity of ~95 GW, with new additions like Vogtle Units 3 & 4 being the first new reactors in decades. The DOE aims to reach 300 GW by 2050. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for nuclear is $69/MWh, which is lower than gas but higher than wind and solar. Despite high capital costs, nuclear has low fuel and operating costs. In 2023, the U.S. invested $1.2 billion in advanced reactors, with growing private funding for SMRs. The nuclear sector supports over 475,000 jobs.</p>

            <h2>4. Policy & Regulations in the U.S.</h2>
            <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees nuclear safety and licensing, while the Department of Energy (DOE) handles R&D, investment, and policy. Major U.S. policies include the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021) which provides a $6 billion subsidy for nuclear plants, the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) which offers tax credits for zero-emission nuclear, and the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) which supports SMRs. Challenges include an aging reactor fleet, public perception and safety concerns, and nuclear waste management issues.</p>

            <h2>5. Future of Nuclear Energy in the U.S.</h2>
            <p>The DOE aims to triple nuclear capacity to 300 GW by 2050, with SMRs and advanced reactors expected by the 2030s and fusion power possible by the 2050s. Key drivers for expansion include decarbonization and climate goals, energy security, and the cost competitiveness of new technologies. Challenges to overcome include policy and regulatory barriers, public perception and community opposition, and financing large-scale projects.</p>
